1. Cratetd the Databases: (a) Query image database of 42 in number
                          (b) Database of 5K images
                          (c) Database of 16L images

2. Convert the query image database into mat file and then sequence file and keep this sequene file in HDFS.(a1 and a2)

	hdfs dfs -put **path-of-mat-file** hdfs://mater:9000/**output-directory**

3. Convert the Database 5K images database into mat file and then sequence file and keep this sequene file in HDFS. (a1 and a2)

	change datastore path in a3_.*.m ( line number 31)
	change input path in od_mapper_job2.m (line numbr 16)
	check database size in database_properties.txt ( 3rd value)


4. Now execute the a3 which is the main program for comparing and givne the result as prediction matrix but as sequence file

5. Now execute 'a4' which will convert the prediciton matrix in sequence file into text format (sublime.txt)

6. Final results will be given by 'a5' i.e. percentage.
